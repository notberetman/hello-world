# hello-world
My demonstration repository
notberetman here, just playing around with Github. I would like to use Git to develop some technical manuals and I am just learning how things work. This seems striaght forward here on the website, but I haven't got the hang of Github Desktop yet. So this is just for leaning how to commit changes
